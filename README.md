Kodi-plugin that displays a hibernate-confirmation dialog

The only purpose of this plugin is to display a simple cancel/OK-dialog so the
user could confirm the hibernation after a recording has been finished.

The plugin is activated via a JSON RPC call issued by a VDR recording hook that
could be found here: https://github.com/Rosepeter/vdr_recording_hook
